## How to use

### Login

Upon lauching the app, you will presented with the login page where you can login (if you have an account) or register yourself.

In case you do not want to create an account, there is already a default account with the following credentials:

> **email:** miguel.r.ferreira@ua.pt  
> **password:** MiguelF07

### Main Page

After logging in, you will be redirected to the main app. This will be the focus of it. Here you will have to give two types of permissions: the fine location and the activity permission. Firstly you will be asked to give the fine permission in order to display your location on the map. Once given, the map will present your location.

Upon clicking the `Start` button, you will be asked to give the activity permission, which will be responsible for asking for your steps. After giving this permission, your tracking will start and you will be able to see the metters you have walked/runned and the number of steps (the value may take a while to update). After clicking the `Stop` button, the tracking will be stopped and your statistics will be added to your profile.

### Profile

On the main page you can click the `Profile` button that will redirect you to the profile page. Here you can see your overall statistics and you can also logout of the application.
